üìò Topic: SQL Aggregate Functions - MIN() and MAX()
üõ†  Purpose: Retrieve smallest or largest values from a column
===========================================================

üîç Definitions:

‚úÖ MIN():
   - Returns the **smallest (minimum)** value in a column.
   - Commonly used with numeric, date, or text columns.

‚úÖ MAX():
   - Returns the **largest (maximum)** value in a column.

‚úÖ Syntax:
   SELECT MIN(column) FROM table;
   SELECT MAX(column) FROM table;

üìå These are **aggregate functions**, meaning they return a **single value**.
üìå Use with `GROUP BY` to apply MIN/MAX per group (not covered here).
