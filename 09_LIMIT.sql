üõ†  Purpose: Restrict the number of rows returned in a query
===========================================================

üîç LIMIT:

‚úÖ What is LIMIT?
   - LIMIT is used to **restrict the number of rows** returned by a `SELECT` query.

‚úÖ Why use LIMIT?
   - It helps optimize performance and quickly preview data (e.g., in large tables).
   - Often used with `ORDER BY` for pagination or top results.

‚úÖ Syntax:
   SELECT columns FROM table
   [WHERE condition]
   ORDER BY column
   LIMIT number;

üìå Note:
   - LIMIT always appears at the **end** of the query.
   - Supported in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
   - For MS SQL Server, use `TOP` or `FETCH NEXT`.
